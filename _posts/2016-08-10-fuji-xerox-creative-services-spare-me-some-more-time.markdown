Finally have to time to write something. I have a busy job. Now with the Fuji Xerox Creative Services, I can finally have some free time.

We’ve been collaborating with staffs of Fuji Xerox Creative Services. We have to create brochures, mail and advertisements. They provide the technology and people that we can work with, making the processes less complex. At least we don’t need to produce everything all by ourselves, Fuji Xerox Creative Services will help bring the ideas to life.

I made some last-minute changes, and they responded to them efficiently. I wasn’t that worried that they couldn’t make it, but instead that they would get mad at me for being so sudden. Real professionals like those offering Fuji Xerox Creative Services just wouldn’t mind.

It’s been some time since the last time you heard about me. I’ll update myself more often from now on.
